										<h2>Why Jazz?</h2>
										<p>Jazz has often been described as the music of innovation. What evolved between a confrontation in culture led to a syncretism of genre. As technology continues to develop in both the music world and in other fields, there arises a need to continue Jazz's cultural heritage in new, dynamic ways.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Virtual/Augmented Reality Technology</h3>
											<p>New developments in multimedia have introduced a new way to watch movies, play games, and experience the world. It is called Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR). This new technology tracks the movement of your head while 2 displays (one for each eye) create a 3 dimensional experience that allows users to see a new world all around them. If TVâ€™s were looking through a window, VR is climbing out of one.</p>

										<article>
											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<h3 class="major">Music Technology</h3>
											<p>Live looping. MIDI controllers. Electric Trumpet. Ableton Live 10 will be used for most on-stage audio manipulation. This incredibly powerful Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) can do amazing things. With paired with other cutting-edge technology, the sonic possibilities of new sound is expanded well beyond the scope of traditional jazz.</p>

										<article>
											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/pic06.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<h3 class="major">Music Composition</h3>
											<p>Portraits of Change will feature 7 different pieces of music that have been influential or innovative to Jazz in some way. Each piece will vary in style, genre, and instrumentation quite radically to emulate the cultural heritage of jazz. </p>

											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/pic07.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<h3 class="major">Cooperative Creativity</h3>
