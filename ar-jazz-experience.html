											<h3 class="major">Virtual/Augmented Reality Technology</h3>
											<p>New developments in multimedia have introduced a new way to watch movies, play games, and experience the world. It is called Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR). This new technology tracks the movement of your head while 2 displays (one for each eye) create a 3 dimensional experience that allows users to see a new world all around them. If TVâ€™s were looking through a window, VR is climbing out of one.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Music Technology</h3>
											<p>Live looping. MIDI controllers. Electric Trumpet. Ableton Live 10 will be used for most on-stage audio manipulation. This incredibly powerful Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) can do amazing things. With paired with other cutting-edge technology, the sonic possibilities of new sound is expanded well beyond the scope of traditional jazz.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Music Composition</h3>
											<p>Portraits of Change will feature 7 different pieces of music that have been influential or innovative to Jazz in some way. Each piece will vary in style, genre, and instrumentation quite radically to emulate the cultural heritage of jazz. </p>

											<h3 class="major">Cooperative Creativity</h3>
											<p>The way the music is created is the same as it will be heard. Through near complete improvisational-music development, the live show will always sound brand new, and will always look brand new.</p>

					<h4></h4>
								<p>Virtual reality (VR) is an interactive computer-generated experience taking place within a simulated environment. It incorporates mainly auditory and visual feedback, but may also allow other types of sensory feedback. This immersive environment can be similar to the real world or it can be fantastical. </p>
									<p>Augmented reality (AR) is a similar experience, where simulated objects and environments are then interwoven in the real world. This technology has made leaps and bounds in tracking, picture quality, and computing power in the past year alone.</p>
<p>While VR gaming has yet to break the sales required to make the technology accessible, AR technology is already being used in the corporate workforce to revolutionize productivity. The artistic capability of this technology seems to have been ignored or temporarily forgotten, and it is the primary goal of Portraits of Change to use this technology and other new and exciting innovations to transform how musicians create music and how audiences listen to it.</p>								
	<p>With AR technology, we can track instruments and music in real time, and have animations and effects permeate around the sound. When the trumpet is blaring a high note, fire can release from the bell. Sparks fly off of the piano, more energetic and frantic the harder the key press is. We can make trees grow around us, and form galaxies at the end of our horns. We can tell stories, we can travel back in time. The music played live will always be different, and can make a new and original AR experience with every performance. The audience can interact with the musicians in more ways than ever imagined.</p>	
									
									<p>AR and VR technology also revolutionize the way we practice music. In-house music tools are being developed that will become publicly available for use when they are finished. </p>
									<p>It isn't an easy feat to undertake, but the artists behind Portraits of Change are confident that with the right tools and right people, we can create a tangible, functional, and most importantly creative product.</p>

									<p><small>the Hololens 2 is currently the most advanced AR device, expected to release late 2019. This technology is not a distant possibility, but a certain reality.</small></p>

									
									
									<h3 class="major">a new Sound</h3>
									<p>wah-wah pedals, reverb, and looping were all innovations to sound that has been used in jazz for a very long time. Even in the 70's, Miles Davis was using this technology along with post-processing to change the sound of a trumpet in a completely new way. If Miles Davis had the technology available today, he could do it live and to greater depths of creativity. MIDI allows us almost any instrument to be replicated effortlessly on stage, with the same stream of data affecting virtual environments. With MIDI 2.0 on the verge of public release, the possibilites are only limited to how many artists have access to these new technologies. </p>
									
									<h3 class="major">a new Music</h3>
									<p>Within Portraits of Change are 7 "Portraits," or musical sound environments that contain a virtual world that interacts with the live jazz being produced corresponding to the Portrait. Each portrait features either an influential jazz work, a collection of jazz works, or is an adaption of one. </p>
									
									
											<h4>Portraits</h4>
												<ul>
												
												
									<li>African Skies</li> 
									<li>Donna Lee</li> 
									<li>Bitches Brew</li> 
									<li>Angel Eyes</li> 
									<li>Resolution </li>
													
									</ul>
									<p>Portraits of Change will attempt to showcase the innovation made in a famous recording or performance related to the Portrait, while innovating in our own way another quality of the music. Sometimes it will be subtle, sometimes it will not.</p>
