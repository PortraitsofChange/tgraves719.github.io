									<h3 class="major">a new Reality</h3>
									<p>
</p>
					<h4></h4>
								<p>Virtual reality (VR) is an interactive computer-generated experience taking place within a simulated environment. It incorporates mainly auditory and visual feedback, but may also allow other types of sensory feedback. This immersive environment can be similar to the real world or it can be fantastical. </p>
									<p>Augmented reality (AR) is a similar experience, where simulated objects and enviroments are then interwoven in the real world. This technology has made leaps and bounds in tracking, picture quality, and computing power in the past year alone.</p>
<p>While VR gaming has yet to break the sales required to make the technology accessible, AR technology is already being used in the corporate workforce to revolutionize productivity. The artistic capability of this technology seems to have been ignored or temporarily forgotten, and it is the primary goal of Portraits of Change to use this technology and other new and exciting innovations to transform how musicians create music and how audiences listen to it.</p>								
	<p>With AR technology, we can track instruments and music in real time, and have animations and effects permeate around the sound. When the trumpet is blaring a high note, fire can release from the bell. Sparks fly off of the piano, more energetic and frantic the harder the key press is. We can make trees grow around us, and form galaxies at the end of our horns. We can tell stories, we can travel back in time. The music played live will always be different, and can make a new and original AR experience with every performance. The audience can interact with the musicians in more ways than ever imagined.</p>	
									
									<p>AR and VR technology also revolutionize the way we practice music. In-house music tools are being developed that will become publicly available for use when they are finished. </p>

									
									<h3 class="major">The Tools we need</h3>
									<p>It isn't an easy feat to undertake, but the artists behind Portraits of Change are confident that with the right tools and right people, we can create a tangible, functional, and most importantly creative product.</p>

									<p>the Hololens 2 is currently the most advanced AR device, expected to release late 2019. This technology is not a distant possibility, but a certain reality.</p>
